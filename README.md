## Prerequisites

- Create an account [https://expo.io/signup](https://expo.io/signup)
- iOS : [http://bit.ly/expo-ios-client](http://bit.ly/expo-ios-client)
- Android : [http://bit.ly/expo-android-client](http://bit.ly/expo-android-client)

## Setup

```console
yarn add global expo-cli
```

```console
git clone <repo>
cd twitter-clone-native
yarn
```

## Running the app

To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

```console
yarn start # you can open iOS, Android, or web from here, or run them directly with the commands below.
yarn android
yarn ios
yarn web
```

This should start up your browser on [`http://localhost:19002/`](http://localhost:19002/). From there you can scan the QR code. ðŸ¤³
