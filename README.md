## Prerequisites

## Setup

## Running the app

To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

```console
cd twitter-clone-native
yarn start # you can open iOS, Android, or web from here, or run them directly with the commands below.
yarn android
yarn ios
yarn web
```

This should start up your browser. If you're familiar, this is a standard expo application.
