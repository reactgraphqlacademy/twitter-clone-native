# React Native Animations

## Learning objectives

## 🤸‍♀️ Exercise 1

Go to `src/Screens/AnimationExample.js` and do the following tasks:

- Task 1, animate the View so it moves on the Y axis 200 units
- Task 2, animate the background colour of the View so it goes from red to green using the rgba(0,0,0,1) format. Hint, you need to interpolate the animated value.
- Task 3, animate the View as follows:
  - It moves on the Y axis twice what it does on the X axis.
  - The View should change the background color from green to blue
  - The opacity of the View should go from 0 to 1
  - The duration for all the animations should be 2 seconds.

## 🤸‍♀️ Exercise 2

Final exercise, let's create the Twitter user profile on scroll animation and use all the animations we've learned 🎉

Go to `src/Screens/RootNavigator.js` and replace `export const RootNavigator = AnimationExample;` with `export const RootNavigator = createAppContainer(MainNavigator);`

- Task 1, Replace the `scrollY = 1;` at the top of the ProfileScreen class with an animated value (initial value 1)
- Task 2. Add an [Animated.event](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated#handling-gestures-and-other-events) for the on scroll event in the ScrollView
- Task 3, animate the cover image adding the following opacity:
  - When the scroll is 0 then the opacity is 1
  - When the scroll is 125 then the opacity is 0
- Task 4, animate the View that wrapps the TopBar component so it has the following opacity:
  - When the scroll is 0 then the opacity is 0
  - When the scroll is 100 then the opacity is 0.1
  - When the scroll is 125 then the opacity is 1
- Task 5, animate the Avatar size so when the user scrolls the Avatar becomes smaller
- Task 6, use [useNativeDriver:true](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated#using-the-native-driver) in the configuration of the animation. Hint, if you used the style props width and height on task 5 then you'll need to refactor them to use the prop transform scaleX and scaleY.

### 🏋️‍♀️ Bonus

Animate the Avatar so when the user scrolls down and the Avatar gets smaller the center of the Avatar stays in the same position.
