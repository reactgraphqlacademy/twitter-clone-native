# React Native Navigation

##¬†Learning objectives

- Understand how routing works on mobile application

## ü•ë Before we start the exercise

- There plenty others routing solutions available, keep in mind we are using the `react-navigation` library.

## ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Exercise 1

- [ ] Create a Stack Navigator in `src/Screens/PublicNavigator.tsx` that shows the `LoginScreen` and the `TOSScreen`.

Tips: - You can read the official documentation [https://reactnavigation.org/docs/stack-navigator/](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/stack-navigator/)

- You can use the above LOGIN_SCREEN and TOC_SCREEN as route names

- [ ] Add some options to the navigator

  - headerMode: none
  - mode: 'modal'
  - initialRouteName: LOGIN_SCREEN (optional)

- [ ] Update the entry point of the app with `createAppContainer` using the PublicNavigator in `src/Screens/RootNavigator.js`.

_Hints:_

- In `src/Screens/PublicNavigator.js` you can use the constants LOGIN_SCREEN and TOC_SCREEN defined in the PublicNavigator.js to name your screens to maintain consistency when navigating.

## ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Exercise 2

- [ ] In `src/Screens/RootNavigator` create a Switch Navigator called `MainNavigator` with a PRIVATE and a PUBLIC view (check the imports!). You need to update the entry point of your app in `createAppContainer`.

## ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Exercise 3

1. In `src/Screens/TimelineNavigator.js` create a stack Navigator ([https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/stack-navigator.html](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/stack-navigator.html)) for the TimeLine using the following screens:

```javascript
  [TIMELINE_FEED_SCREEN]: TimelineScreen,
  [TWEET_DETAIL_SCREEN]: TweetDetailScreen,
  [USER_PROFILE]: ProfileScreen,
```

2. Let's style our Navigator! We need to pass an extra parameter to change the configuration as follows.
   2.1. The header backgroundColor for this navigator should be `Colors.brand.primary`. Hint use the `headerStyle` in `defaultNavigationOptions` [https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/stack-navigator.html#stacknavigatorconfig](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/stack-navigator.html#stacknavigatorconfig)
   2.2. The [headerTintColor](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/stack-navigator.html#headertintcolor) should be `Colors.light` (check the imports for the colors in `src/Screens/TimelineNavigator.js`).

## ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Exercise 4

- [ ] 1. in `src/Screens/TimelineScreen.tsx`:

  - [ ] 1.1. the header title for this view should be `Timeline`
  - [ ] 1.2. Implement the `handleTweetPress` method to send the user to the `TWEET_DETAIL_SCREEN` screen, passing the `id` as a parameter.

Hint: [https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigation-prop/#navigate](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigation-prop/#navigate)

- [ ] 2. in `src/Screens/TweetDetailScreen.tsx`
  - [ ] 2.1. Set the header title for this view should be `Tweet`
  - [ ] 2.2. Implement the `handleProfilePress` method to send the user to the `USER_PROFILE` screen, passing the parameters below:

```javascript
  {
    userId: this.state.tweet.user.id_str,
    name: this.state.tweet.user.screen_name
  }
```

Hint: [https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigation-prop/](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigation-prop/)

### üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Bonus `src/Screens/PrivateNavigator.js`

- [ ] Create a `BottomTabNavigator` and use it as `PrivateNavigator` for your app:

- This will be an extra layer on your app. the entry point for you Private Section.
- You can use the already created `PrivateNavigator` file to start with.
- Define getTabBarIcon and use if to assign Icons to both Views
- The two tabs should be the `MAIN_TIMELINE_SCREEN` that loads the already created `TimelineNavigator`, and the `MY_PROFILE` route that will render the `ProfileScreen` with the "user's data".
- `ProfileScreen` expects some paramenters in order to load the user's data. you need when the user "presses"
  the tab, you need to pass the correct parameters from the current logged user (now hardcoded). Hint: [https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/bottom-tab-navigator.html#tabbaronpress](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/bottom-tab-navigator.html#tabbaronpress)
- you have a utility function defined to get the icon for the tabs that you need to finish implementing and using it.
